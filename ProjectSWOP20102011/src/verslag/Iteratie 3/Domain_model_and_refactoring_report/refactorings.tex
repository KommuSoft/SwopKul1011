\section{Refactorings}
\subsection{FindBugs}
Before we actually started focused refactoring, we fist used a small tool named \name{FindBugs}. This is a tool developed by the \name{University of Maryland}. This program resulted in finding 16 ``bugs''\footnote{They use the word bug very widly. For instance naming conventions and performance issues were marked as bugs}. The bugs were classified in the following categories:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Correctness (1)
 \item Bad Practices (8)
 \item Experimental (1)
 \item Performance (5)
 \item Dodgy (1)
\end{itemize}
Only 6 of them were real issues and have been fixed.
\subsection{Focused Refactoring}
Taking a break in coding gives the opportunity to look again at your code through new eyes. By reviewing our code we found some minor issues that could have been done better.
