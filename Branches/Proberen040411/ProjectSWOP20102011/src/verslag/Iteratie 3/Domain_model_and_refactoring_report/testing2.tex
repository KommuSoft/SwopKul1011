\paragraph{Coverage}
By extending the tests the coverage of the project grew. With the standard coverage tool of \textit{NetBeans}: \textit{EMMA} we could determine that 80\% of the lines of the project were covered. Only 3 classes were not covered\footnote{less than 50\% of the lines covered}. When we took a closer look to these classes the uncovered lines were trivial methods or constructors that for example only called the parent constructor or returned the value of field.
\paragraph{Covering pseudo covered lines}Another thing we noticed was that sometimes lines who were marked as covered, were not at all. For instance calling a method that needs to concatenate two arrays succeeded the coverage test. But when we commented that line, the test still succeeded!\footnote{The reason was that in all the testcases at least one of the two arrays was empty.} We used commenting and uncommenting as a tool to see what lines were really covered. Tests were added to make sure important parts of the code were truly covered, and not only ``pseudo covered''. Perhaps this way of testing lines far more deep could be automated to do deep testing. If all test still pass if a line is removed this could be a signal to the developer that something is wrong with it's test cases.
